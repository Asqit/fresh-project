# fresh project

This is a fresh project starter code. It uses regular `tailwindcss-cli` for
styling instead of `twind`. Before actually firing up the deno server, it is **required** to fetch the tailwindcss. To fetch the tailwind use a shell script `fetch_tailwind.sh` or visit official [repo](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/) and after downloading the copy rename it to `tailwindcss`. 

## Starting the project

To start the project, run following command:

```sh
deno task start
```
