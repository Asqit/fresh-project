# Fresh Project

This repository contains starter code for projects made with `fresh`. This
project uses regular `tailwindcss-cli` instead of default `twind`.

## Before start the project

Before actually firing up the deno server, it is **required** to fetch tailwind
css and have deno runtime installed. Linux / Mac users can use the prepared
shell scripts, that will automatically prepare the environment.

So if you don't have deno runtime, you can use the `install.sh` script, that
will install deno and fetch copy of tailwind css for your platform and
architecture.

If you do have deno runtime installed, use only the `fetch_tailwind.sh` script.

## Starting the project

To start the project, run following command:

```sh
deno task start
```
